    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Clicking the 'Enter' button below will start the VR visualisation. When the menu appears on the right, choose the countries data you would like to view. on a mobile device, performance will be optimal if you choose only a single country to view at a time.
        If you are on a desktop computer you can choose 'show all', which will allow you to view all of the data points even from a distance. When you are ready click 'submit and build'.</li>
      <li>You can now click or tap the goggles icon in the bottom right corner to enter VR if you are using a headset.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Navigation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Desktop: Click and drag to look around, W,A,S,D or arrow keys to move. Use cursor to look at and select language data beacons.</li>
      <li>Mobile: touch in gray panel on left side to move forward, touch and drag elsewhere on the screen to look around. Use cursor to look at and select language data beacons.</li>
      <li>Cardboard VR: Look around and move forward using cardboard button. Use cursor to look at and select language data beacons.</li>
      <li>Desktop VR: (Vive prefered) Look around and move using the right-hand controller’s touchpad. Use cursor to look at and select language data beacons.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="title">Collecting Links</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Each language has an information panel you can bring up by looking at its data beacon. By looking at the world link icon you can save a link to more information about that language to view once you finish exploring in VR.</li>
      <li>By looking at the audio icon, you can isolate the sound of that particular language. When you move again, the other language will once again start to fill the environment.</li>
      <li>Return to this page and click the 'Explore Links' button to look over the links you have saved for more information on a language.</li>
