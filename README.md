# glossopticon-webvr

Glossopticon is a series of tools initially created for the visualisation of data from the PARADISEC Pacific and Region archive of linguistic data. This is an initial release of code and research that represents a WebVR, A-Frame based version of the project, with that hope that it is useful to other projects in either its current or extended form.

## Getting Started

Download or clone the repository and run it on a web local server. If you do not have a workflow for this, the easiest workflow is to open the entire project in Brackets and run it using the inbuilt live server, or Atom and run it using the Atom live server plugin. The project has to run on a local web server (or be uploaded to a remote web server) and will generate errors if it is simply ran directly ion a browser due to cross origin domain issues.
